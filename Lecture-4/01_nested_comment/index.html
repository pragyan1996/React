    Question: Build mutiple comment box.

    Use case:
       1. Mutiple replies(Example: slack, reddit)
       2. Feedback box with mutiple threads.
       3. FB chat 

    Flavour:
       1. JSON Data -> File system

    Must have features:
       1. No of thread for a comment.
       2. How deep Tree can be?
       3. display comment 

    Good to have features -> optimization, accessibility.
       1. Option of reaction(emojies) over replies
       2. We are presist the entire comment thread.

    Approach:
        1. HTML/CSS:
           a. Get the static HTML.
           b. I try to simulate dynamic behaviour into static html to see how my JS which change DOM after click on reply.

        2. JavaScript.
           a. Event listner:
              1. reply button -> after click I will see a input box and submit button
              2. Submit button will give input which change to 'comment-card' with a reply-button.

        3. Edge case:
