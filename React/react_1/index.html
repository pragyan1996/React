        ->It is opensource js library and supported by one of the largest communities.
        ->Used to develop complex and interactive web and mobile UIs.
        ->Follows the component based approach which helps us to build reusable UI components
    
    Is react a front end library or framework?
        It is front end library.
    
    Difference between library and framework?
        ->Library: Pre written code for specific task that you can use as required, allows you to control your code structureðŸ¥².
        ->Framework: A ready-made structure and a toolkit that helps to build the applications
                     by following its rules and patterns that make the development smoother.
    
    Who invented ReactJS library?
    -> React library was created/invented by Jordan Walke, a S/W wroking for FB.
    
    What are the benefits of using ReactJS library?
    
    1.) Uses Virtual DOM rather than real DOM, because the manipulations are expensive operations directly over real DOM.
    
    2.) Follows uni directional data flow or data binding.
    
    3.) Follows component based approach.
    
    4.) Uses the reusable UI components to develop the UIs.
    
    5.) offer fast rendering.
    
    6.) Comes with useful deevloper toolset.
    
    7.) Supports SSR.
    
    8.) one of the largest community support established.
    
    9.) React acts as a standard for the mobile app development.
    
    10.) Easy to learn.
    
    Setting up the development environment using CDN link.
    -> we be using React 18 version
    
    What is component?
    -> It's an independent and reusable piece of code.
    -> They are just same functions in JS, but they work in isolation and retun the JSX elements.
    
    What is JSX?
    -> JSX stands for Javascript XML or syntactical extention of JavaScript.
    -> JSX = HTML + JS
    
    //const x = 10;
    const element = <h1> Hello, Ashwani. </h2>;
    
        -> JSX is not understood by browser, you need convert it into JS objects.
        Babel is used to transpile that takes JSX and get converted into JS objects.
    
        React DOM: it's JS library that is used alonf React JS
        library to render the componnets or JSX elements into the real DOM of a web page.
    
        What is props?
        -> props stands for properties.
        -> A way to pass data from one component to another component
        or share the data from one comp to another comp.
        -> Props are immutable so we can't modify the props inside the component.
    
        What is component composition?
        -> Componnet composition means putting small and resusable components together to build complex UI.
        // return <div>
            //
            <Hello username="Tony" age={28} />
            //
            <Hello username="Akash" />
            //
            <Hello username="Uzma" age={26} />
            //
            <Hello username="Sahil" age={25} />
            //
            <Hello username="Ashwin" age={30} />
            //
        </div>;
        What is rendering List in React?
        -> A list of data to be displayed in an ordered format and mainly
        used for the menus or the list of ites over the web apps.
        -> we use map() -> JS HOF
